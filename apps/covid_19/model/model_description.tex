\section{Base model construction}
\subsection{Platform for infectious disease dynamics simulation}

We developed a deterministic compartmental model of COVID-19 transmission using the AuTuMN platform,
publicly available at https://github.com/monash-emu/AuTuMN/.
Our repository allows for the rapid and robust creation and stratification of models of infectious disease epidemiology
and includes pluggable modules to simulate heterogeneous population mixing, demographic processes, multiple circulating
pathogen strains, repeated stratification and other dynamics relevant to infectious disease transmission.
The platform was created to simulate TB dynamics, being an infectious disease whose epidemiology differs markedly
by setting, such that considerable flexibility is desirable \cite{RN58}.
We have progressively developed the structures of our platform over recent years,
and further adapted it to be sufficiently flexible
to permit simulation of other infectious diseases for the purpose of this project.
