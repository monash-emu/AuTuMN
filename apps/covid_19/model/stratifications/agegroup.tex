\subsection{Age stratification}
All compartments of this base compartmental structure were stratified by age into five-year bands from 0-4 years of age through to 70-74 years of age, with the final age group being those aged 75 years and older. Heterogeneous baseline contact patterns by age were incorporated using age-specific contact rates estimated by Prem et al. 2017 \cite{RN19}, who combined survey response data with information on national demographic characteristics to produce age-structured mixing matrices with these age groupings. These are then modified by non-pharmaceutical interventions. Our modelled age groups were chosen to match these mixing matrices. The automatic demographic features of AuTuMN that can be used to simulate births, ageing and deaths were not implemented, because the issues considered pertain to the short- to medium-term and the immediate implementation of control strategies, for which population demographics are less relevant.
