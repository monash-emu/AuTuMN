Data notes:,,,,,,,
2012 was not available,,,,,,,
Infectiousness of index (smear/culture status) not clear from this data,,,,,,,
Unclear if contacts were completely evaluated,,,,,,,
Missing DOB on many patients so data was not broken down by age,,,,,,,
Some positive TSTs may be previous positives ,,,,,,,
Missing treatment completion information,,,,,,,
Missing number of active cases found during CI activities,,,,,,,
In 2016 it looks like a lot of patients had symptom screen done but it is unclear if they received a TST,,,,,,,
