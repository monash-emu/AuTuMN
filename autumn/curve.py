        y: The dependent variable at each observed point
        method: Select an interpolation method. Methods 1, 2 and 3 use cubic interpolation defined step by step.
            1: Uses derivative at each point as constrain --> see description of the encapsulated function
            derivatives(x, y). At each step, the defined portion of the curve covers the interval [x_i, x_(i+1)]
            2: Less constrained interpolation as the curve does not necessarily pass by every point.
            At each step, the defined portion of the curve covers the interval [x_i, x_(i+2)] except when the derivative
            should be 0 at x_(i+1). In this case, the covered interval is [x_i, x_(i+1)]

            the interval [x_i, x_(i+1)] but x_(i+2) is still used to obtain the fit on [x_i, x_(i+1)]
            4: Uses sigmoidal curves. This is a generalisation of the function make_two_step_curve
            5: Uses an adaptive algorithm producing either an interpolation or an approximation, depending on the value
            of the smoothness. This method allows for consideration of limits that are defined through bound_low and
            bound_up. See detailed description of this method in the code after the line "if method == 5:"
        smoothness, bound_up, bound_low, auto_bound are only used when method=5
        smoothness: Defines the level of smoothness of the curve. The minimum value is 0. and leads to an interpolation.
        bound_low: Defines a potential lower bound that the curve should not overcome.
        bound_up: Defines a potential upper bound that the curve should not overcome.
        auto_bound: In absence of bound_up or bound_low, sets a strip in which the curve should be contained.
                    Its value is a multiplier that applies to the amplitude of y to determine the width of the
                    strip. Set equal to None to delete this constraint.
        intervention_end: tuple or list of two elements defining the final time and the final level corresponding to a
                    potential intervention. If it is not None, an additional portion of curve will be added to define
                    the intervention through a sinusoidal function
        intervention_start_date: If not None, define the date at which intervention should start (must be >= max(x)).

        """
        This method produces an approximation (or interpolation when smoothness=0.0) using cubic splines. When the
        arguments 'bound_low' or 'bound_up' are not None, the approximation is constrained so that the curve does not
        overcome the bounds.
        A low smoothness value will provide a curve that passes close to every point but leads to more variation changes
        and a greater curve energy. Set this argument equal to 0.0 to obtain an interpolation.
        A high smoothness value will provide a very smooth curve but its distance to certain points may be large.
        We use the following approach:
        1. We create a curve (f) made of cubic spline portions that approximates/interpolates the data, without any
            constraints
        2. We modify the initial and final sections of the curve in order to have:
            a. Perfect hits at the extreme points
            b. Null gradients at the extreme points
        3. If bounds are defined, we detect potential sections where they are overcome and we use the following method
            to adjust the fit:
            3.1. We detect the narrowest interval [x_i, x_j] which contains the overcoming section
            3.2. We fit a cubic spline (g) verifying the following conditions:
                a. g(x_i) = f(x_i)  and  g(x_j) = f(x_j)
                b. g'(x_i) = f'(x_i)  and  g'(x_j) = f'(x_j)
            3.3. If g still presents irregularities, we repeat the same process from 3.1. on the interval [x_(i-1), x_j]
                or [x_i, x_(j+1)], depending on which side of the interval led to an issue
