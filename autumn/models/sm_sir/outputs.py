    Work out how much we are going to adjust the age-specific hospitalisation and mortality rates by to account for pre-
    existing immunity protection against hospitalisation and mortality.
    The aim is to get the final parameters to come out so that the weighted average effect comes out to that reported by
    Nyberg et al., while also acknowledging that there is vaccine-related immunity present in the population.
    To do this, we estimate the proportion of the population in each of the three modelled immunity categories:
        - The "none" immunity stratum - representing the entirely unvaccinated
        - The "low" immunity stratum - representing people who have received two doses of an effective vaccine
            (i.e. the ones used in the UK: ChAdOx, BNT162b2, mRNA1273)
        - The "high" immunity stratum - representing people who have received their third dose of an mRNA vaccine
    The calculation proceeds by working out the proportion of the UK population who would have been in each of these
    three categories at the mid-point of the Nyberg study and using the estimated effect of the vaccine-related immunity
    around then for each of these three groups.
    We then work out the hospitalisation and mortality effect for each of these three groups that would be needed to
    make the weighted average of the hospitalisation proportions come out to the original parameter values (and check
    that this is indeed the case).
