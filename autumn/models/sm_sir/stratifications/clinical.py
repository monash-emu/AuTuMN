    """
    Only stratify the infectious compartments, because in the dynamic model we are only interested in the
    epidemiological effect - and these are the only infectious compartments (unlike the Covid model).
    For the symptomatic fractions - this can only be implemented as age-specific. There is currently no code to allow
    for a constant symptomatic/asymptomatic fraction (although this could be done relatively easily).
    If only partial case detection is applied and not an asymptomatic fraction, then the case detection rate should be
    considered as the proportion of all infections that are detected as cases.

    Args:
        model: The model object we are working with, even though the stratification is applied outside this function
        compartments: Unstratified model compartment types
        params: All model parameters
        infectious_entry_flow: The name of the flow that takes people into the (first) infectious compartment(s)
        sympt_props: Symptomatic proportions, or None if stratification by symptomatic status not required
        non_detect_func: The undetected proportion function generated by add_detection_processes_to_model
        cdr_func: The detected proportion function generated by add_detection_processes_to_model

    Returns:
        Clinical stratification object to be applied in the main model file, or None if stratification irrelevant
