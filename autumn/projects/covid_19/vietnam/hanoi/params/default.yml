# All information provided here are HISTORICAL. Last update: 15th Jan, 2022.
# All figures calculated below are available at: https://bit.ly/Hanoi_vaccination_status
# To illustrate the vaccination for under 18, we illustrate the population in three parts: over 20, 15 - 20, and under 15
# Before 23/11, only individuals over 18 are fully vaccinated.
# This vaccination scheme assumes that all 2nd doses given between 14/12/2021 to 30/12/2021 are for individuals aged 12-17 years.
