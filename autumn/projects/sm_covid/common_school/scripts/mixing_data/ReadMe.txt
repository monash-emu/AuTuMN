Data extraction process:
- List all the surveys available from socialmixr that were not conducted during COVID (i.e. non-CoMix surveys)
- Keep the list of surveys for which school contacts are distinguished from non-school contacts
- The retained list of surveys is available from the file 'socialmixr_list.csv'

Further selection:
- Two data sources were found for Belgium. Only the Polymod survey was retained for better consistency between countries in terms of methodology.
- The Zambia-South Africa study was excluded because it included adults only.
- Two surveys were available for the UK (Polymod and a survey including infants only). We use the Polymod survey.
- For the russian dataset (https://www.pnas.org/doi/epdf/10.1073/pnas.1821298116), the survey was conducted during periods of school closure (for flu) as well during regular periods. Only the regular period was considered for extraction.
