description: >
  New variant twice as transmissible as Omicron (~4 times more transmissible than Delta VoC).
  This variant completely escapes both vaccination- and infection-related immunity.
  Severity (hospitalized and fatality risk) is reduced by half compared with the Omicron variant.
  Since this variant is fully immune-escape, the detection prop is also reduced by half.
  Vaccine-induced immunity is waned.
