description: >
  The new variant is twice as transmissible as Omicron (~4 times more transmissible than Delta VoC).
  This variant is more immune-escape than Omicron, but not totally towards vaccination- and infection-related.
  Severity (towards hospitalization and fatality) is less than the Omicron variant.
  Waning vaccine-induced immunity makes the overall immunity level returning to 10% for the whole population.
