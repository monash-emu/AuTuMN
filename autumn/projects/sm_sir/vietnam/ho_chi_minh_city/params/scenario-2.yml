description: >
  The new variant is twice as transmissible as Omicron (~4 times more transmissible than Delta VoC).
  This variant is more immune-escape than Omicron, but not totally towards vaccination- and infection-related.
  Severity (towards hospitalization and fatality) is equal to half of that of the Omicron variant.
  Booster dose is assumed to be effective for 120 days (~4 months).
