  SCENARIO 3A
  The new variant is twice as transmissible as Omicron (~4 times more transmissible than Delta VoC).
  This variant is more immune-escape than Omicron, but not totally towards vaccination- and infection-related.
  Severity (towards hospitalization and fatality) is twice that of the Omicron variant (more severe).
  Booster dose is assumed to be effective for 180 days (~ 6 months).
  Booster dose is continued to be administered uniformly among age groups at the rate of 2000000 doses per month.
