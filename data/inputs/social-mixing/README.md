# Country Mixing Matrices

Mixing matrices are pulled from [Projecting social contact matrices in 152 countries using contact surveys and demographic data](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005697#sec020) by Prem et al. in PLOS Computational Biology in 2017.

This paper is accompanied by age and location specific mixing matrices for 152 countries. Available [here](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005697.s002).

The Prem paper provides mixing matrices for 5 location types:

- home
- school
- work
- other_locations
- all_locations

The rows and columns indices of each matrix represent a 5 year age bracket from 0-80, giving us a 16x16 matrix.
