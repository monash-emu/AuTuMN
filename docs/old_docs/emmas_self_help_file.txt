to get things started for autumn covid, have the following programs on your computer

conemu -useful for using all sorts of bash, cmd and gitbash type environments
anaconda3 -make sure it is on the system path. this is crucial
anaconda prompt, should come with the anaconda3 package
open anaconda promtp -after installing anaconda3, you get this from the program file dropdown, or from a quick search/(or powershell etc if this is easier for you) use python to load all of the requirements by

navigating to the file AuTuMN
pip install -r requirements.txt
otherwise this can be done one by one in the spyder console

also pip install streamlit
open anaconda navigator
set up an environment in the environment tab, and give it a name; I called mine autmnenv
launch spyder
set folder to AuTuMN\apps
open  "run_pycharm.py"
within file "run_pycharm.py" there is a choice of models to run
uncomment the one you want to run and run the file

go to AuTuMN/data to find your outputs ***

when wanting to modify parameters for the scenarios:
the hierarchy starts with AuTuMN/apps/COVID-19/params/base.yml
this can be overwritten for each country inside the file ~/params/[country name]
default is the baseline scenario then they are named scenario1, 2, 3 etc.

when you run_pycharm.py, it points to the base.yml then is overwritten by country default (for country baseline) then the scenarios one by one.

to conduct uncertainty runs there is another.py file
AuTuMN/apps/process_mcmc_outputs.py, which I don't know how to run yet




*** output is found in  AuTuMN/data 

these can be viewed directly as jpeg files but you can also see them in streamlit

open a powershell (using conemu)

THIS IS NOW DONE AUTOMATICALLY AS AN OPENING COMMAND
	write conda activate autmnenv  (for james this is conda activate summer (he must have called the environment by this name)
	navigate to directory AuTuMN

enter
	streamlit run plots.py (this sits at AuTuMN/plots.py)

if you just finished a calibration and MCMC using for example
streamlit run plots.py mcmc (this sits at AuTuMN/plots.py)



to run an MCMC go to the calibration folder C:\Users\jc343421\Documents\GitHub\AuTuMN\apps\covid_19\calibration

%% before committing:
go to github gui and look for conflicts
in order to commit only some files
goto the right environment
$ git add file1 file3

$ git commit -m 'my commit message'

open conemu: to test the code I have changed, before I commit the code, from there I can run the 
pytest


to check if my new commits might crash ou thte system

tests are automatically done on all new commits and this takes about 20 minutes, so check it out on github online.

Adding a new COVID model
How to add a new COVID model

Add your region's name to autumn.constants.Region
Add your region's default parameters to apps/covid_19/params/{region_name}/default.yml (see other similar files for an example)
Add your region's plotting config to apps/covid_19/plots/{region_name}.yml (see other similar files for an example)
open .autumn.demography.social_mixing and map the new country to the mixing matrix you want to use e.g. "nsw": "australia"   #this was suggested by Milinda when I got an error
Create and register a RegionApp for your region in apps.covid_19.__init__
You can now run your model from the command line

python -m apps run region-name
or you can open apps.run_pycharm and run by putting your region name after REGION = Region.


Registering a COVID model for calibration
Add your calibration script to apps.covid_19.calibration under your region's name (snake case)
Update apps.covid_19.calibration.__init__ to register your calibration script
You can now run a calibration


#################### BUT first 
add this to the end of the app.covid_19.calibration.(region_name)
if __name__ == "__main__":
    run_calibration_chain(
        15 * 60 * 60, 1
    )  # first argument only relevant for autumn_mcmc mode (time limit in seconds)

in order to run the calibration chain


python -m apps calibrate regionname
