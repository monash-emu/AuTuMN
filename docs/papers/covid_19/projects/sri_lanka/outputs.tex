\section{Calculation of outputs}

\subsection{Incidence}
Incidence is calculated as any transitions into the early active compartment (\textit{``I"}).

\subsection{Hospital occupancy}
Hospitalisation numbers are not reported in the case of Sri Lanka, because the approach to hospitalisation in the country differ considerably from that adopted in the other countries to which the AuTuMN model is applied. Therefore, our approach to simulating hospitalisations is not applicable to Sri Lanka.

\subsection{ICU occupancy}
This is calculated as all persons in the late active compartment in clinical stratum 5.

\subsection{Seropositive proportion}
This is calculated as the proportion of the population in the recovered (\textit{``R"}) compartment. Although very similar numerically to the attack rate, persons who died of COVID-19 are not included in the denominator.

\subsection{COVID-19-related mortality}
This is calculated as all transitions representing death, exiting the model. This is implemented as depletion of the late active compartment.

\subsection{Notifications}
Local case notifications are calculated as transitions from the early to the late active compartment for clinical strata 3 to 5.
