\section{Scenarios}
To inform evidence-based relaxation of mobility restrictions, we considered the impact of several mobility strategies in controlling the epidemic in Sri Lanka. The considered scenarios are
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Returning contact rates at workplaces and ``other locations'' (meaning other than workplaces, schools and households) to the maximum level observed in the 90 days to 12th June 2021
	\item  Returning contact rates at workplaces and ``other locations'' to mid-way between the the maximum level observed in the 90 days to 12th June 2021 and the most recent mobility levels (during lockdown)
	\item Re-opening all schools and educational facilities, while all other restrictions remain in-place (i.e. mobility stays at lockdown levels for workplaces and other locations)
\end{enumerate}

Here the baseline assumes that the current mobility restrictions are continued indefinitely.
