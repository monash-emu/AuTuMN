\subsection{School closures}
The effect of Victorian school closures is captured through the timeline presented in Table \ref{tab:school_timeline}.

\subsection{Macrodistancing in workplaces and other locations}
The functions applied here are determined by the Google mobility data according to Table \ref{tab:mobility_map}, as described above, but are applied separately for each service. Because Google mobility data pertains to local government areas (LGAs), whereas health service clusters may receive patients from across the state, it was necessary to map mobility data to services. Health service clusters' overall mobility values in each location were calculated using a weighted average of LGA mobility values according to the historical pattern of the origin of patients presenting to services within each service.

As a hypothetical example, if 50\% of patients historically presenting to Barwon South West health services come from the City of Geelong, the mobility data for the City of Geelong will contribute 50\% of the Google mobility estimate of Barwon South West.

Historical patterns of patient presentations by health service cluster were provided by the Victorian Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS).

\subsection{Microdistancing approach}
In this application to Victoria, the microdistancing function \(m(t)\) is comprised of two components: physical distancing and face coverings. Both physical distancing and face coverings micro-distancing are applied to the three non-household locations, such that the microdistancing function for non-household locations is given by: \[m(t)=d(t)^2\times f(t)^2\]
The two interventions are assumed to be independent and so are multiplicative. As for the macrodistancing functions, the two functions of time are squared to represent their effects on both the infector and the infectee in any potentially infectious interaction.

\subsection{Physical distancing}
The physical distancing function \(d(t)\) is a transposed and translated hyperbolic tan function. The parameters of this function were estimated by using maximum a posteriori inference, with priors that penalised large shape parameters (to avoid extremely rapid transitions). The proportions of respondents answering ``always" to YouGov surveys of Victorian residents asking ``Thinking about the last 7 days, about how many people from your household have you come into physical contact with (within 2 meters / 6 feet)?" were used as input data. Resulting parameters were: shape, 0.262764; lower asymptote, 0.2803973; upper asymptote; 0.4421819; and inflection point, 15\textsuperscript{th} July. The resulting function is presented in Figure \ref{fig:physical}.

\subsection{Face coverings}
Two separate face coverings microdistancing functions are employed, one for metropolitan and one for regional health service clusters. These functions were fitted using the same methods as for physical distancing, using YouGov data on Victorian residents' survey responses to the question ``Thinking about the last 7 days, have you worn a face mask outside your home (e.g. when on public transport, going to a supermarket, going to a main road)?". Estimated parameters were: shape, 0.5261693; lower asymptote, 0.130469; upper asymptote, 0.9143849; and inflection point, 23\textsuperscript{rd} July (consistent with the policy change in metropolitan Melbourne). This was applied directly to metropolitan services and translated ten days later for regional services, where face coverings were mandated from the 2\textsuperscript{nd} August. The resulting function is presented in Figure \ref{fig:face}.
