\section{Preamble}
This document describes the methods used for projecting burden of COVID-19 in Victoria for the Victorian Government Department of Health from September 2021 onwards.
The model is similar in construction to that used for similar purposes in the latter part of 2020 during Victoria's second COVID-19 wave.
The analysis of the second wave was submitted to a major international journal and has now been revised three times, such that publication is hopefully imminent.
This work is also publicly available as a pre-print on the \textit{medR\(\chi\)iv} server \href{https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.04.03.21254866v2}{here}.
The pre-print did not include structure for contact tracing, which was added during revision of the re-submitted manuscript and is included in the model described here.
The current version of the model also includes structure for vaccination, which has not been used in our analyses for Victoria previously.
