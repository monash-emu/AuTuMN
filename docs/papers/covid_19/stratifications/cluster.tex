\section{Model initialisation}
The model was commenced from around one to two weeks earlier than the actual beginning of Victoria's second wave (as determined by genomic analysis), in order that the distribution of infectious persons distributes naturally across compartments as the model approaches the actual beginning of Victoria's second wave in early June. The actual start date selected was the 14\textsuperscript{th} May. The infectious seed needed at this time was then calibrated to ensure dynamics were realistic at the beginning of the second wave. The infectious seed is distributed evenly across metropolitan clusters, consistent with the epidemic's emergence from metropolitan Melbourne.
