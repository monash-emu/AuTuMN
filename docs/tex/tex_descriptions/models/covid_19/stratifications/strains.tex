\subsection{Modelling Variants of Concern (VoC)}
To consider the effects of VoC on infection dynamics and the vaccination programs, we explicitly simulated three competing strains to represent the wild-type or ancestral virus, Alpha and Delta VoC strains, which are the two main VoC strains that circulated in Sri Lanka during the study period. The two VoC strains were associated with increased transmissibility relative to wild-type and the respective transmisibility levels of each VoC strain were calibrated from the model. Susceptible individuals can be infected with either the wild-type or VoC strain and infectious individuals contribute to the force of infection with their respective infecting strain only. VoC strains are seeded into the model such that 25 additional persons per day are infected with a particular VoC strain for a duration of ten days, with the time that this ten-day period commences varied during model calibration.
