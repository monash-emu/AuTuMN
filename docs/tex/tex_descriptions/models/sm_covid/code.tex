\section{Software and code used to conduct the analyses}

\subsection{Code}
The Python code and data used to perform the analyses is fully available on Github at the following link:
\href{https://github.com/monash-emu/AuTuMN}{https://github.com/monash-emu/AuTuMN}. In particular, the code 
associated with the implementation of the model is \href{https://github.com/monash-emu/AuTuMN/blob/c6a9a3f6c81e39808dfb5383a342de2079ac8f1b/autumn/models/sm_covid2/model.py#L178-L537}{\textcolor{blue}{available here}}.
The suite of functions used to run the model, perform calibration and analyse the outputs is \href{https://github.com/monash-emu/AuTuMN/blob/master/autumn/projects/sm_covid2/common_school/runner_tools.py}{\textcolor{blue}{available here}}.
Finally, the model can be run for the included countries via an online Google Colab notebook, allowing the user to conduct their own analyses without
any local software installation requirement. \textcolor{red}{NEED TO CREATE NOTEBOOK}
