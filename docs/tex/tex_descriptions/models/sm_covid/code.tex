\section{Software and code used to conduct the analyses}

\subsection{Code}
The Python code and data used to perform the analyses is fully available on Github at the following link:
\url{https://github.com/monash-emu/covid19_school_closures}. In particular, the code 
associated with the implementation of the model is \href{https://github.com/monash-emu/covid19_school_closures/blob/main/autumn/models/sm_covid2/model.py#L184-L549}{\textcolor{blue}{available here}}.
The suite of functions used to run the model, perform calibration and analyse the outputs is \href{https://github.com/monash-emu/covid19_school_closures/blob/main/autumn/projects/sm_covid2/common_school/runner_tools.py}{\textcolor{blue}{available here}}.
Finally, the model outputs can be explored in detail for all analyses via an \href{https://monash-emu.github.io/outputs/covid19-school-closures/}{\textcolor{blue}{online interactive interface}}, without
any local software installation requirement. 

We also provide detailed instructions on how to install and run our model locally on the project's \href{https://github.com/monash-emu/covid19_school_closures/blob/main/README.md}{\textcolor{blue}{GitHub webpage}}.
