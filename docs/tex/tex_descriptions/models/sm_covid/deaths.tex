We estimate the number of COVID-19 deaths over time using a similar approach 
as for the hospital pressure indicator. We use the age-specific infection fatality rates reported in
ODriscoll et al. \cite{odriscoll-2021}, adjusted for vaccination status and for the infecting strain
to estimate COVID-19 mortality. Using the same notations as in Section \ref{hosp}, the number of COVID-19
deaths observed at time $t$ is obtained by:
\begin{equation}
\mu(t) = m_C \sum_{a,v,s} ifr_{a,v,s} \int_{u \geq 0}  i_{a,v,s}(t-u)g_{d}(u) du   \quad,
\end{equation}
where $ifr_{a,v,s}$ is the risk of death given infection for age $a$, vaccination status $v$ and strain $s$, 
and $g_d$ is the probability density function of the statistical distribution chosen to represent the 
time from symptom onset to death (\textcolor{red}{See Table XX}). We use a country-specific adjuster $m_C$ to 
capture the fact that the infection fatality ratio is expected to vary by country, in part due to 
differences in COVID-19 death definition and reporting standards. This adjustment is automatically calibrated 
by the MCMC (Section \ref{calibration}).
