The risk of hospitalisation given infection was expected to vary markedly by setting.
For example, different countries may have different criteria for whether or not a COVID-19 
patient should be admitted to a hospital. This makes it difficult to provide accurate 
estimates of hospitalisation rates for multiple countries. 

For this reason we introduced a universal indicator named ``hospital pressure'' in our analysis. This indicator
was obtained by considering the age-specific risk of hospitalisation given infection observed in the first year
of the pandemic in the Netherlands, adjusted for vaccination status and for the infecting strain (Tables \ref{param_table} and \ref{agespec_table}).
The ``hospital pressure'' indicator can therefore be interpreted as the level of hospital occupancy that
would be observed in the analysed country if the rates of hospitalisation given infection in this country were the same
as for the Netherlands. This quantity is expected to vary proportionately with occupancy over time, providing an indicator of 
hospital pressure. Note that this indicator was used in order to make comparisons between scenarios, such that one should interpret the relative
differences between scenarios rather than the absolute values of the indicator. 

Let us denote $i_{a,v,s}(t)$ the number of new disease episodes estimated to start at time $t$ for people aged $a$ with vaccination status $v$
and infected with strain $s$. The number of new hospital admissions occurring at time $t$ was calculated using the following
convolution product:
\begin{equation}
 \eta(t) = \sum_{a,v,s} \kappa_{a,v,s} \int_{u \geq 0}  i_{a,v,s}(t-u)g_{h}(u) du   \quad,
 \end{equation}
where $\kappa_{a,v,s}$ is the risk of hospitalisation given infection for age $a$, vaccination status $v$ and strain $s$ 
based on the Netherlands data, and $g_h$ is the probability density function of the statistical distribution chosen to represent the 
time from symptom onset to hospitalisation (Table \ref{param_table}). 

We then computed the ``hospital pressure'' quantity $h$, which is an indicator of hospital occupancy level, by combining the number of new 
hospital admissions $\eta$ with the statistical distribution used to model hospital stay duration:
\begin{equation}
h(t) = \int_{u \geq 0}  \eta(t-u) (1 - \tau(u)) du   \quad,
\end{equation}
where $\tau$ is the cumulative density function of the statistical distribution chosen to represent the 
hospital stay duration (Table \ref{param_table}).
