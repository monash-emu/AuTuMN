All compartments of the base compartmental structure were stratified by age into the following bands:
zero to 14 years / 15 to 24 years / 25 to 49 years / 50 to 69 years / 70 years and above.

The initial population was distributed between the different age bands to reflect the age distributions reported by the United Nations Population Division. Demographic processes, including births, ageing and non-infection-related deaths are not simulated, given the timeframes considered in this simulation.

We assumed heterogeneous mixing between the different age groups to account for the assortative nature of social interactions by age (see Section \ref{mixing}).
Age was assumed to affect:
\begin{itemize}
    \item susceptibility to infection
    \item risk of COVID-19 hospitalisation
    \item risk of COVID-19 death
    \item vaccination rate (see Section \ref{vaccination})
\end{itemize}
