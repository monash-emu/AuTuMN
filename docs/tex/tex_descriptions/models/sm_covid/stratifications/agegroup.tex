% Note that this will vary for every application, so will need to be edited - not sure of how best to manage this:
All compartments of the base compartmental structure are stratified by age into the following age bands:
zero to 14 years / 15 to 24 years / 25 to 49 years / 50 to 69 years / 70 years and above.

The initial population is distributed between the different age bands to reflect the age distributions reported by the United Nations Population Division. Demographic processes, including births, ageing and non-infection-related deaths are not simulated, given the timeframes considered in this simulation.

We assume heterogeneous mixing between the different age groups to account for the assortative nature of social interactions by age (\textcolor{red}{see relevant section}).
Age is assumed to affect:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The susceptibility to infection
    \item The risk of COVID-19 hospitalisation
    \item The risk of COVID-19 death
    \item The vaccination rate (\textcolor{red}{see vaccination section})
\end{itemize}
