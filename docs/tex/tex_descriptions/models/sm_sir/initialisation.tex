\section{Infectious seed}
The infectious seed value is assigned to the early infectious compartment
(i.e. the fully infectious compartment).
This value is subtracted from the total modelled population,
with the remainder of the total population then assigned to the susceptible compartment, 
while all other compartments are assigned a starting value of zero.
This process is undertaken before stratifications are applied,
with the stratification processes then splitting these values proportionately
according to the starting age distribution of the population.
The exception to this is seeding by strain,
with all of the starting infectious seed assigned to the starting strain.
