\section{Scaling of contact rates}
The base mixing matrix can be disaggregated into age-specific contacts that occur 
in the following four settings:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Home
    \item Other locations
    \item Work
    \item School
\end{itemize}
The contact rates in each of these settings are scaled as indicated in 
Table \ref{tab:location_scaling}.
The quantity indicated in the Table is considered as a proportion relative to
the baseline value of one.
This quantity is then squared to consider that reductions in mobility will affect
both the potential infector and infectee who will not visit the setting considered.
