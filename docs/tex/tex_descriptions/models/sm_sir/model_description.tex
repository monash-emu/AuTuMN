\section{Model Structure}

\subsection{Recent model adaptations}

Our COVID-19 model is a series of compartments representing transitions between states relevant to infection with SARS-CoV-2 and onward transmission of this virus.
Unlike previous iterations of this model 
(including our past publications on the epidemics in the Philippines 
\cite{caldwell-2021-a}, Malaysia \cite{jayasundara-2021} and Victoria, Australia \cite{trauer-2021-a}), 
our current model now considers only states relevant to transmission.
Hospitalisation, admission to ICU and death are no longer represented as explicit model states, 
but are now calculated from model outputs through a convolution process.
The rationale for this approach is that the explicitly modelled states 
are reserved for the representation of processes relevant to epidemic transmission dynamics only.
Any other relevant outcomes are then calculated 
from the quantities that are tracked during the process of numerically solving the dynamic system (``derived outputs''), 
including through convolutions.
It should be noted that the process of calculating derived outputs 
is done after each model iteration, 
such that these quantities can still be compared to empirically observed outcomes 
and so used for calibration.

\subsection{Compartments}
Model compartments represent sequential progressions through the processes of 
infection with, progression through, and recovery from the phases of SARS-CoV-2
infection and COVID-19 disease.
Reinfection is permitted in our model structure, 
which is represented as transition from the recovered compartments 
back to the first infected compartment.
The following compartments were implemented:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Susceptible
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Persons never previously infected with SARS-CoV-2 during the model simulation period
    \end{itemize}
    \item Latent
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Persons recently infected with SARS-CoV-2, but not yet infectious 
        (i.e. representing the infection latent period rather than the incubation period)
        \item This phase is divided into two sequential compartments or phases
    \end{itemize}
    \item Infectious
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Persons with active COVID-19 who are potentially infectious to others
        \item This phase is divided into two sequential compartments or phases
        \item The second of these two sequential compartments 
        includes any persons who are identified through the health system and asked to isolate
        \item The infectiousness of the second compartment/phase 
        is reduced to capture the effect of case isolation
    \end{itemize}
    \item Recovered
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Persons recovered from COVID-19 during the model simulation period
        \item This phase is divided into two sequential compartments
        \item Reinfection from these compartments is permitted 
        and occurs at a different rate from the susceptible compartment 
        and at a different rate for each of the two sequential phases
        \item This compartment retains the stratification by strain 
        (or variant of concern (``VoC'')), 
        with the strain of the most recent infection episode
        determining the persons classification by strain
        (and hence their strain-specific immunity to subsequent infections)
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
