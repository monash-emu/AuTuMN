\section{Age stratification}
% Note that this will vary for every application, so will need to be edited - not sure of how best to manage this:
All compartments of the base compartmental structure were stratified by age into the following age bands:
\begin{itemize}
    \item 0 to 4 years
    \item 5 to 9 years
    \item 10 to 14 years
    \item 15 to 19 years
    \item 20 to 24 years
    \item 25 to 29 years
    \item 30 to 34 years
    \item 35 to 39 years
    \item 40 to 44 years
    \item 45 to 49 years
    \item 50 to 54 years
    \item 55 to 59 years
    \item 60 to 64 years
    \item 65 to 69 years
    \item 70 to 74 years
    \item 75 years and above
\end{itemize}
Demographic processes, including births, ageing and non-infection-related deaths 
are not simulated, given the timeframes considered in this simulation.
