\section{Strain stratification} \label{strain}
\subsection{General approach}
The model is stratified by ``strain'' or Variant of Concern (VoC),
adopting the summer approach to strain stratification 
through the \code{StrainStratification} object.
This general approach is described in full in the 
\href{http://summerepi.com/examples/8-strain-stratification.html}{summer strain documentation} 
This approach explicitly represents multiple competing strains,
each with a separate force of infection calculation.
This framework allows independent calculations of 
the force of infection for each of the modelled strains,
with the compartmental infectiousness multipliers applied identically 
for each of the competing strains.
Additional strain features 
(such as differential infectiousness and duration of latency and active disease)
were then implemented with the standard summer stratification features,
such as adjustments to flow rates.

\subsection{Seeding of new VoC}
Seeding of each new strain into the model 
is achieved through the addition of an importation flow
that introduces a small number of new infectious persons with the new VoC into the model.
To achieve this, 
a new entry flow is added to the model 
with destination being the early infectious compartment.
The rate of this flow is a step function that transitions from zero 
to the requested daily rate of seeding for the requested number of days,
before stepping back down to zero for the remainder of the period simulated.
