\subsection{Age stratification}
% Note that this will vary for every application, so will need to be edited - not sure of how best to manage this:
All compartments of the base compartmental structure were stratified by age into the following age bands:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Zero to 14 years
    \item 15 to 24 years
    \item 25 to 49 years
    \item 50 to 69 years
    \item 70 years and above
\end{itemize}
Demographic processes, including births, ageing and non-infection-related deaths are not simulated, given the timeframes considered in this simulation.
