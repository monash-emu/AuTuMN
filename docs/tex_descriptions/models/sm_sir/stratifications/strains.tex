\section{Strain stratification} \label{strain}
The model is stratified by ``strain'' or Variant of Concern (VoC)
to represent explicitly multiple competing strains, each with a separate force of infection calculation.
This adopts the summer approach to strain stratification through the StrainStratification object.

\subsection{Seeding of new VoC}
Seeding of each new strain into the model is achieved through the addtion of an importation flow
that introduces a small number of new infectious persons with the new VoC into the model.
To achieve this, a new entry flow is added to the model with destination being the early infectious compartment.
The rate of this flow is a step function that steps from zero to the requested daily rate of seeding for the requested number of days,
before stepping back down to zero for the remainder of the period simulated.
