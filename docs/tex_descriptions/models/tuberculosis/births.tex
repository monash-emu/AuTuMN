\subsection{Births and deaths}
Births are modelled using time-variant crude birth rates that are multiplied by the modelled population 
size to determine the number of newborn individuals entering the model at each time. A time-variant 
and age-specific rate or non-TB-related mortality applies to all model compartments to simulate 
deaths from other causes than TB. We use estimates from the UN population division to inform the 
birth and mortality rates.
We also apply additional death rates to the compartments I and T to reflect mortality induced by TB 
disease.
