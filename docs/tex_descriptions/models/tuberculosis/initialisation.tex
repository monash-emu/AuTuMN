\section{Infectious seed}
The infectious seed value is assigned at the start of simulation process.
This value is subtracted from the total modelled population and assigned to the susceptible compartment, while all other compartments are assigned a starting value of zero.
This process is undertaken before age stratification is applied,
with the stratification process then splitting these values proportionately according to the starting age distribution of the population.
