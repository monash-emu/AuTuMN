% Note that this will vary for every application, so will need to be edited - not sure of how best to manage this:
All compartments of the base compartmental structure were stratified by age, location and organ status:\linebreak

    \item Zero to 14 years
    \item 15 to 24 years

    \item 70 years and above
\end{itemize}
