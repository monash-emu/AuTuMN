\subsection{M.tb Tranmission}
We use different levels of susceptibility to infection for individuals who are currently latently infected 
with M.tb or have recovered from active TB, as compared to infection-naive individuals. The effect of 
BCG vaccination is captured by reducing the susceptibility to infection of individuals under the age of 
30 years old. We assume a 70\% reduction in the susceptibility of BCG-vaccinated children under the 
age of 15 years old. A linear function is used to reflect the progressive loss of BCG immunity 
between the age of 15 and 30 years old.
