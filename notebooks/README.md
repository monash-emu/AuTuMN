All Jupyter notebooks (.ipynb files) should be stored in the following structure:  

```

notebooks/            # This folder  
    examples/         # Example notebooks  
    user/             # Individual user notebooks, with user subfolders (examples below)  
        bblessed/     # Notebooks belonging to Brian Blessed  
        hmirren/      # Notebooks belonging to Helen Mirren  
```

This heirarchy may be expanded from time to time.  Do not commit notebooks outside of this structure.
