    "\n",
    "So far we've looked at how to create a compartmental model, add flows, request derived outputs and use different solvers. Now we'll look into stratifying a model using the [Stratification](http://summerepi.com/api/stratification.html) class.\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, we have modelled the effects on overall population. However, the infection dynamics vary greatly with age. For example, the infection mortality may vary across different age groups with older age groups having a higher risk of death. For immunizing infections, a larger proportion of children are susceptible to infection than adults, as children have had only fewer years of exposure to infections than adults. To capture such differences that are observed in the population structure, we can use stratifications in our models. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A commonly used stratification is age-based stratifications. Here, the basic methodology in stratification is to sub-divide the population into a number of discrete compartments classified by the age. Although age is a continuous parameter, age-structured models usually group individuals into a limited number of classes. The number of compartments will depend on factors such as data availability and the problem being addressed. In age-structured models the individuals can progress into increasingly older age classes. For example, if there are two compartments as children and adult, at a certain rate the children would move to the adult compartment and the interactions between these two compartments happen through the transmission between them. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Such stratifications are useful in analysing childhood infections, stratifying the model to reflect different strains with different characteristics (e.g., risk of death, transmission level) and implementing age-specific interventions such as vaccine allocation and school closure. \n",

    "\n",
    "When you do a partial stratification, flow rates into that stratified compartment will automatically be adjusted with an even split to conserve the behaviour by default, e.g. a flow rate of 3 from a source will be evenly split into (1, 1, 1) across the three destinations. This behaviour can be manually overriden with a flow adjustment."
