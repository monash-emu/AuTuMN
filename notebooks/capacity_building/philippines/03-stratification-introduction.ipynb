    "## Stratification introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "So far we've looked at how to create a compartmental model, add flows, request derived outputs and use different solvers. Now we'll look into stratifying a model using _summer_'s [Stratification](http://summerepi.com/api/stratification.html) class.\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, we have modelled transmission dynamics across the overall population, with the population being entirely homogeneous except with regards the infection-related states. However, we may wish to consider that the infection dynamics vary with age, which they do in the case of COVID-19. For example, infection mortality may vary across different age groups, with older age groups having a higher risk of death. For some infections, we may also wish to consider differences in susceptibility to infection or differences in infectiousness. To capture such differences that are observed in the population structure, we can use stratifications in our models. \n",
    "\n",
    "A commonly used stratification is age-based stratifications. Here, the basic stratification methodology is to sub-divide the population into a number of discrete compartments classified by the age. Although age is a continuous parameter, age-structured compartmental models must group individuals into a limited number of classes. The number of compartments will depend on factors such as data availability and the epidemiological question being addressed. In age-structured modelsm, we may wish to allow people to progress into increasingly older age classes, although this would be less relevant for short-lived epidemics.\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest way to approach is to allow for two strata (children and adults), without any ageing between the two strata.\n",
    "\n",
    "Age stratification would be essential to consider epidemiological issues or interventions that act differentially on different age categories, or where we wish to get age-specific outputs from our model.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example we'll cover:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [No stratification](#No-stratification)\n",
    "- [Minimal stratification](#Minimal-stratification)\n",
    "- [Population distribution](#Population-distribution)\n",
    "- [Flow adjustments](#Flow-adjustments)\n",

    "- [Multiple stratifications](#Multiple-stratifications)\n",
    "- [Multiple interdependent stratifications](#Multiple-interdependent-stratifications)\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that stratification is just about the most complicated thing we can do with a compartmental model, and throws up \n",
