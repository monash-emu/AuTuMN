    "# Heterogeneous mixing\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, the Summer compartmental model assumes that each person in the model comes into contact with every other person at the same rate (homogeneous mixing). This assumption is preserved even after stratification has been applied (by default), such that the force of infection calculation will be the same for all model strata implemented. This notebook considers the incorporation of heterogeneous mixing patterns. For example, children may tend to interact more with other children than they do with elderly people (this is termed with-like or assortative mixing). When considering the impact of control strategies, especially strategies targeting sub groups of people, it is likely to be important to consider these differences in contact patterns.\n",
    "\n",

    "Before we get into the code for heterogeneous mixing, let's start off with some of our standard (or \"boilerplate\") code to get everything set up."
