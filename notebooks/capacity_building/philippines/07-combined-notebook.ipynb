    "## Thinking about the pieces\n",
    "\n",
    "### What do we have in the model that reflects COVID-19 epidemiology and biology\n",
    "##### Age-stratified heterogeneous mixing; \n",
    " For COVID-19 and respiratory viruses in general social mixing plays an important role in dynamics\n",
    "##### Variants/strains; \n",
    " Viral evolution leading to different variants/strains with different underlying characteristics has been and continues to be a   key driver in COVID-19 epidemiology.\n",
    " We are capturing some of these properties by allowing the Omicron variant to have greater relative transmissibility than that     of the Delta variant.\n",
    "##### Waning immunity from infection; \n",
    "Immunity from natural infection wanes over time.\n",
    "##### Vaccines; \n",
    " Vaccination is arguebly the most important public health intervention against COVID-19.\n",
    " We are capturing the effect of vaccination on reducing the risk of death.\n",
    " We are capturing the effect of vaccination on reducing susceptibility to infection, i.e. reducing the risk of infection in     vaccinated individuals.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What might we be missing?\n",
    "##### Differences in disease severity; \n",
    " We are not accurately capturing the spectrum of disease. \n",
    " For example,  asymptomatic vs symptomatic disease and hospitalisations (and ICU admissions). We could include stratification to capture by asymptomaitc and symptomatic infection states. This might be important for thinking about case ascertainment and thus the case detection rate parameter employed in the model.\n",
    "##### Variants/strains; \n",
    " We are not capturing all strain/variant properties (or all strains..).\n",
    " We are only simulating the Delta and Omicron variants as these led to the most impactful waves of transmission in Malaysia, but we could simulate more, such as Beta variant and wild-type.\n",
    " Not entirely capturing how immunity varies with variants (i.e. immune escape). In this model infection with Delta variant (before waning) provides complete (sometimes called sterilising immunity) against infection with the Omicron variant. Whilst this is true for some diseases, it is not true for COVID-19. \n",
    " Successive variants have shown significant capacity to typically escape immunity derived from infection with prior variants, this has been most pronounced for the Omicron variant.\n",
    "Other viral properties such as difference in the generation/latent period is not captured. There is evidence to suggest that for Omicron in particular shorter latency (time from exposure to active infection) played a role in it’s fitness advantage over Delta.\n",
    "We are also not capturing difference in variant/strain virulence. i.e. Delta > virulence than Omicron.\n",
    "##### Vaccination; \n",
    "We are not capturing all effects of vaccination, differences in doses or waning vaccine immunity\n",
    "The impact of vaccination on reducing infectiousness or onward transmission is not captured, but is an important effect. Also not capturing effects on severity other than Death.\n"
