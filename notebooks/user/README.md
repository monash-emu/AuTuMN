Commit your personal notebooks in here  

If you don't have a folder already, create one using the first initial, surname convention,  
e.g.

Nigel Havers ->  
```
notebooks/
    user/
        nhavers/  
```

By default, AuTuMN is configured to use nbstripout when committing notebooks.

Your local notebooks will retain the outputs as you run them, but only the clean (stripped) notebook will be committed to git.
