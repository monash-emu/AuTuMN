Infectious period & Calibrated, see priors table & This quantity is difficult to estimate, given that identified cases are typically quarantined. Studies in settings of high case ascertainment and an effective public health response have suggested a duration of greater than 5.5 days \cite{Bi2020}. PCR positivity, which may continue for up to two to three weeks from the point of symptom onset \cite{He2020a} \cite{Byrne2020a} does not necessarily indicate infectiousness. The duration infectious for asymptomatic persons has also been estimated at 6.5 to 9.5 days \cite{Byrne2020a}. \\
