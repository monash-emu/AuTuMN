Infectious period & Calibrated, see priors table & This quantity is difficult to estimate, given that identified cases are typically quarantined. Studies in settings of high case ascertainment and an effective public health response have suggested a duration of greater than 5.5 days \cite{bi-2020}. PCR positivity, which may continue for up to two to three weeks from the point of symptom onset \cite{he-2020} \cite{byrne-2020} does not necessarily indicate infectiousness. The duration infectious for asymptomatic persons has also been estimated at 6.5 to 9.5 days \cite{byrne-2020}. \\
Rate of effective contacts & Calibrated, see priors table & Calibrated within plausible range \\
Case detection rate (proportion of infections captured through surveillance) & 0.2  & Assumed \\
