When we refer to Parameters (with an upper-case P), we are referring specifically to the computegraph objects that encode the name (key) of a parameter, and are used to describe the connection between values passed in to run() and the internal processes of the model itself.\n",

    "There are however, a few things we definitely _never_ want in the graph.  Consider file or network I/O.  Unless we're writing very basic tests, there's a good chance that most practical models will need to load data from somewhere.  This might be something simple like a local CSV file, or something as complex as an SQL database, or something stored on a remote network.\n",
    "\n",
    "We don't want all this overhead involved in every iteration, although we certainly need to do it someplace; we may also need to combine data from multiple sources, performing filtering operations or transformations so we end up with a format appropriate for our model.  In summer1, much of this necessarily occured within the build_model function; which leaves a rather open question about where a 'model' starts and ends - if all this filtering had been performed before we loaded the data from disk, would we still claim it was part of the model?  How about any processes that happened during the original survey that created the dataset in the first place?\n",
    "\n",
    "It's clear in this case that I/O operations should therefore happen before anything enters the graph - now that we know the rules for the creation and propagation of GraphObjects (and their relationship with jax), it is simple enough to see how this code should be structured; do all the I/O before you get any GraphObjects involved.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is also worth considering that, because of the restrictions jax places on us, we may not be able to rely on many external libraries, instead having to write our own equivalent code.  This can be a lot of effort, and is almost certainly more error-prone than a well tested-library that has existed 'in the wild' for some time.  Just because we might want to calibrate something \"one day\", doesn't mean we actually need it right now, and until such time, it can run 'outside the graph', and we can rely on the wider Python ecosystem.\n"
