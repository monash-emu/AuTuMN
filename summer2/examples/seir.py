"""
A slightly more complicated version of the SIR model, with richer outputs.

Create a SIR compartmental model for some fictional disease.
It has four compartments (**S**, **E**, **I**, **R**) and **I** is considered "infectious".
The model will run from **1990** to **2025**.
There will be a starting population of **1000** people, with **10** of them infectious.
