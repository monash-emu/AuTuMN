    A compartmental disease model.

    This model defines a set of compartments which each contain a population.
    Disease dynamics are defined by a set of flows which link the compartments together.
    The model is run over a period of time, starting from some initial conditions to predict the future state of a disease.

    Args:
        times: The start and end times.
        compartments: The compartments to simulate.
        infectious_compartments: The compartments which are counted as infectious.
        time_step (optional): The timesteps to return results for. Does not affect the ODE solver. Defaults to ``1``.

    Attributes:
        times (np.ndarray): The times that the model will simulate.
        compartments (List[Compartment]): The model's compartments.
        initial_population (np.ndarray): The model's starting population. The indices of this
            array will match up with ``compartments``. This is zero by default and can be set with ``set_initial_population``.
        outputs (np.ndarray): The values of each compartment for each requested timestep. For ``C`` compartments and
            ``T`` timesteps this will be a ``CxT`` matrix. The column indices of this array will match up with ``compartments`` and the row indices will match up with ``times``.
        derived_outputs (Dict[str, np.ndarray]): Additional results that are caculated from ``outputs`` for each timestep.

        Pre-run calculations to help determine force of infection multiplier at runtime.

        We start with a set of "mixing categories". These categories describe groups of compartments.
        For example, we might have the stratifications age {child, adult} and location {work, home}.
        In this case, the mixing categories would be {child x home, child x work, adult x home, adult x work}.
        Mixing categories are only created when a mixing matrix is supplied during stratification.

        There is a mapping from every compartment to a mixing category.
        This is only true if mixing matrices are supplied only for complete stratifications.
        There are `num_cats` categories and `num_comps` compartments.
        The category matrix is a (num_cats x num_comps) matrix of 0s and 1s, with a 1 when the compartment is in a given category.
        We expect only one category per compartment, but there may be many compartments per category.

        We can multiply the category matrix by the vector of compartment sizes to get the total number of people
        in each mixing category.

        We also create a vector of values in [0, inf) which describes how infectious each compartment is: compartment_infectiousness
        We can use this vector plus the compartment sizes to get the 'effective' number of infectious people per compartment.

        We can use the 'effective infectious' compartment sizes, plus the mixing category matrix
        to get the infected population per mixing category.

            - the total population per category
            - the infected population per category
            - the inter-category mixing coefficients (mixing matrix)
